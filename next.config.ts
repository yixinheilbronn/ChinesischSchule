             * CSP configuration notes:
             *
             * 'unsafe-inline' in script-src and style-src is required by
             * Next.js for inline scripts and style injection used during
             * server-side rendering and client hydration.  A nonce-based
             * approach would require custom middleware to generate and inject
             * nonces into every response, which Next.js does not natively
             * support in the App Router without significant complexity.
             *
             * 'unsafe-eval' is only included in development mode for Next.js
             * hot module replacement and React runtime patterns.  It is
             * excluded from production builds.
             *
             * These directives weaken CSP protection against inline script
             * injection but are mitigated by other security layers:
             * - DOMPurify sanitization for all user-generated HTML
             * - Strict input validation on all API endpoints
             * - httpOnly session cookies preventing JavaScript access
             *
             * TODO: Monitor Next.js support for nonce-based CSP in App Router
             *       and migrate when stable support is available.
